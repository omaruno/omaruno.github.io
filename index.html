      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
I am a third-year PhD student in the National PhD Program in Artificial Intelligence, with a multidisciplinary background in quantitative biology and biotechnology.
My research focuses on the application of artificial intelligence to the healthcare and life sciences sectors, particularly in developing AI-driven solutions to support biomedical applications and human-centered technologies, such as robotics and rehabilitation systems.
I am also highly interested in the use of AI for genomics, single-cell sequencing, and other biological data domains, where computational models can help uncover complex biological mechanisms and support precision medicine.
During my PhD, I have worked on AI-based terrein recognition systems for lower-limb robotic systems. During a visiting period at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (MPI-IS), I explored self-pretraining techniques of transformer on the long range arena.
Outside the academic sphere, I have a long-standing passion for swimming, which I practiced competitively for over 15 years—an experience that taught me discipline, dedication, and resilience.
I also enjoy taking long walks as a way to reflect and recharge. I'm always open to interdisciplinary collaboration and meaningful exchange, especially at the intersection of AI, biology, and human health.
